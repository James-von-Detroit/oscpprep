In kali-rolling, I have had many issues with 404's when trying to update from the repos.

To fix it, edit this:

/etc/apt/sources.listÂ 

Make these changes to what is there:

deb http://repo.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib

deb-src http://repo.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free


Then, close all folders and open terminal to type:

apt-get clean
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade

## Summary

Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3057191)
Published: May 12, 2015 | Updated: May 27, 2015
Version: 2.0

Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on locally and runs arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows. For more information, see the Affected Software section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Vulnerability Information section.

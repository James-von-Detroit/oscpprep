# CVE-2018-1000001 RationalLove

In glibc 2.26 and earlier there is confusion in the usage of getcwd() by realpath() which can be used to write before the destination buffer leading to a buffer underflow and potential code execution.

Attention: All rights to the exploit writer. I have just compiled and organized a repository for this CVE.

CVE: 2018-1000001 Alias: RationalLove

    exploit-debian - Exploit compiled in debian x64
    exploit-ubuntu - Exploit compiled in ubuntu x64

Am I vulnerable?

To discover if the machine is vulnerable:

dpkg --list | grep -i libc6

If your libc6 package is:

    2.24-11+deb9u1 for Debian Stretch
    2.23-0ubuntu9 for Ubuntu Xenial Xerus

Then you're probably vulnerable.

It is in this repository, and it is named vulncheck.sh. You can use it to determine if the public exploit will work or not based on the libc6 package.
